# Computer-Vision-Hand-Detection

## Real-Time Hand Detection Using MediaPipe and OpenCV

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-time hand detection using computer vision techniques, leveraging Google's MediaPipe library and OpenCV. The system captures live video from a webcam, detects hands, and visualises their landmarks and connections. Below is a detailed breakdown of the methodology, results, and implications.

### Methodology and Technical Details

**1.  Dependencies Installation**

-  MediaPipe: A framework for building multimodal machine learning pipelines, pre-trained for hand detection.

-  OpenCV: Used for image processing, video capture, and rendering.

**2.  Webcam Initialization**

-  The webcam feed is accessed via **cv2.VideoCapture(0)**, where **0** denotes the default system camera.

**3. MediaPipe Hand Detection Configuration**

-  **Hands Model:** A pre-trained ML model from **mediapipe.solutions.hands** detects 21 hand landmarks per hand.

-  **Drawing Utilities:** **mp.solutions.drawing_utils** visualises landmarks and connections.

**4.  Frame Processing Pipeline**

-  **Capture Frame**: Each frame is read from the webcam.

-  **Color Conversion:** Frames are converted from BGR (OpenCV default) to RGB (MediaPipe requirement).

-  **Hand Detection:** The **hands.process()** method analyzes the frame and returns landmarks.

-  **Landmark Visualization:** Detected landmarks and connections are drawn on the BGR frame using **mpDraw.draw_landmarks()**.

-  **Text Overlay:** A label is added to the output frame for project identification.

**5.  Termination**

-  The loop exits when the user presses **"q"**, releasing system resources.

###  Results

-  **Real-Time Performance:** The system achieves smooth real-time detection on standard hardware, suitable for interactive applications.

-  **Accuracy:** MediaPipe's model robustly detects hands in varied orientations and partial occlusions.

-  **Visual Output:** Landmarks (21 per hand) and connections are rendered clearly, enabling applications in gesture recognition and motion tracking.

### Implications and Applications

This project result showcases the potential for **applications in;**

**1.  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** Enables touchless control of devices (e.g., gesture-based navigation).

**2.  Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR):** Facilitates hand tracking for immersive experiences.

**3.  Accessibility:** Supports sign language translation tools for hearing-impaired users.

### Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a pipeline for real-time hand detection using off-the-shelf ML models and computer vision libraries. It highlights the practicality of MediaPipe for rapid prototyping and lays a foundation for advanced applications in HCI and AR/VR.
